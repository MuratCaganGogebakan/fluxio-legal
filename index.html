                        <li>
                            <strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> We collect basic usage information through logs, analytics tools, and cookies.

                            <strong>Image and Content Processing:</strong> When you use the app’s image generation or editing features, the photos you submit are temporarily processed on our servers and with third-party AI providers (such as OpenAI or Google Gemini). We do <b>not</b> keep the images you upload after processing. However, the generated output content is stored securely on a third-party server for up to one week to enable features such as download history, user support, and abuse prevention. After this period, generated content is deleted automatically.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may share aggregated, non-identifiable analytics data with our service partners to help improve the app. No personal or image data is included in such reports.
